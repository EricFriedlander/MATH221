## Smallpox

The smallpox data set provides a sample of 6,224 individuals from the year 1721 who were exposed to smallpox in Boston. Doctors at the time believed that inoculation, which involves exposing a person to the disease in a controlled form, could reduce the likelihood of death. In theconsole below, take a minute to explore the ``smallpox`` dataset:

```{r explore, exercise=TRUE}

```

In the console below, generate a contingency table with `inoculated` in the columns and `result` in the rows. The `janitor` package has been loaded so feel free to use `adorn_totals` if you'd like:

```{r cont-table, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r cont-table-solution}
smallpox %>% 
  count(result, inoculated) %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = result, names_from = inoculated, values_from = n) %>% 
  adorn_totals(where = c("row", "col"))
```

On a separate sheet of paper, compute the table proportions for this data.

Now use R to compute the table proportions to verify your solutions:

```{r table-props, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r table-props-solution}
smallpox %>% 
  count(result, inoculated) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = result, names_from = inoculated, values_from = prop) %>% 
  adorn_totals(where = c("row", "col"))
```

Was it better to be inoculated or not inoculated? Make an argument using marginal, joint, or conditional probabilities and be prepared to discuss with the class.
